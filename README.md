# Housing Cost Calculator #

This is a simple browser-based JS calculator to compare rental costs vs. purchase costs for an apartment or condo over a period of years.
To run, clone this repo and open index.html in a browser. No server needed.
There's also a python version which I originally used to develop the code. I had Claude AI port it over to Javascript (with help).

Live version is at https://housing-cost-calculator.pages.dev/, using Cloudflare Pages.
